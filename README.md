# Description
This application is a project for multimedia discipline developed in JavaScript, HTML and CSS that allows you to play videos from your own playlist. 
You can upload new videos, navigate through playlist and play any video you want, organize videos in any order by drag&drop or even delete them from your playlist.
You can also apply some effects on your current video and activate subtitles (which are stored in a JSON file).
All the items on the control bar from the current video are custom and settings like current time, position in the playlist, volume level and the order of videos in playlist are stored with Web Storage API.
So, next time when you open your video player in the same browser all of these will be saved.<br>
